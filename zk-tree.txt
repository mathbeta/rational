rational using zookeeper to elect master leader, auto discover minions, send master commands to minions and minion responses.

here is the zk tree nodes in the rational system:

/com.mathbeta.rational
    /master
        /leader             for master leader election, child nodes are ephemeral

    /minion
        /minions            for minion auto discovery, child nodes are ephemeral
        /commands
            /request        for master sending commands to minions, one child node for each minion
            /response        for minion sending command execution result to master, one child node for each minion
